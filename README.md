# BayesDiff: Estimating Pixel-wise Uncertainty in Diffusion via Bayesian Inference

## Overview
BayesDiff is a repository focused on estimating pixel-wise uncertainty in diffusion models through Bayesian inference. This repository contains code, models, and experiments that demonstrate the application of Bayesian techniques to diffusion models, enabling more robust and interpretable uncertainty estimation.

## Contents
- **Code**: Scripts and modules for implementing Bayesian inference in diffusion models namely in "sd" and "ddpm_and_guided".
- **Results**: Data and figures from conducted experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method are both in the blogpost.md and the images folder.
- **Blogpost**: A detailed blog post explaining the methodology, experiments, and results in an accessible format.
